# Guess the subreddit 

Posts from the reddit frontpage are randomly selected including their description/picture. You have to guess which subreddit the post belongs to.

You can test it [here](https://ton1ght.github.io/subguess/). Please note that it was only tested on chromium based browser. Firefox is not working yet.

## TODO

* find a way to load json data from reddit without tripping cors
* UI improvements
* highscore (?)
* improve picture sizing (add max_height/max_width)
* add support for youtube videos
* (add support for articles)
